# Day Planner

## Summary
This is a day planner to plan the work day. Each hour has a textbox where the user can write various to-dos and notes. There is a save button next to each hour block that allows the user to save their input to the browser, which puts the input into local storage and loads into the same textbox the next time the user goes onto the Day Planner page.
The text area will turn red based on the current hour. All future hours will be coloured green and all past hours will be coloured mauve.
